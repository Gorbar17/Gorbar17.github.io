# Hello! I’m Bruno!
I'm an aspiring game developer with a strong interest in **Level Design, Game Design and Programming**. I enjoy making Custom Maps for the Games i love, like **Half-Life 2** and experimenting with gameplay flow and environments. I also have some basic experience with **Blender** in 3D modeling and animation.



# My Personal Projects:

## Prototype Platform

![Prototype Screenshot](images/Screenshot1.png)

A little experimental platform game I made, inspired by deathrun/BunnyHop maps you can typically find in famous Source Games (Counter-Strike, Half-Life 2, Garry’s Mod, etc.). The game features two levels, the second with branching paths, a little Main Menu with a Level selector and a Volume Slider.

**Features:**
- Two playable levels (one with branching paths)
- Simple main menu with level selection and Volume slider
- Focus on movement, timing, and player flow

My first attempt at making a complete map from start to finish to practice Level Design with basic scripting, combat, exploration and puzzle solving.
